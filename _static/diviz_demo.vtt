1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
The diviz workbench

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Create a new workflow

3
00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:09.100
Define the name of the workflow

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Search for the weighted sum program

5
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Drag and drop the weighted sum program into the empty workspace

6
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Add the XMCDA file describing the criteria

7
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:29.100
And connect it to the corresponding input of the weighted sum

8
00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:44.200
Repeat for the XMCDA files describing the alternatives, and containing the performance table and the criteria weights

9
00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.300
Execute the workflow

10
00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:05.400
Check the overall values produced

11
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Let's plot the preorder of the alternatives

12
00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:16.100
Drag and drop the program to plot this preorder into the workspace

13
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Connect it to the existing workflow

14
00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:29.100
Edit the properties of the program to rank the alternative with the lowest overall value first

15
00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:35.200
Execute the workflow

16
00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:40.300
Show the preorder

17
00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:46.400
Open an existing workflow

18
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.500
Execute it

19
00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:12.600
Check the history of past executions

20
00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.700
The execution continues in the background (you could even leave diviz and return later)

21
00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:29.800
Check intermediate results of a past execution

22
00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:31.900
The execution is finished

23
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Let's check the latest results
